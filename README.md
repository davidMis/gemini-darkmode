This is an example of a "darkmode" color scheme for the Gemini Beamer poster template. See the original README for me instructions:
https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini

The changes are in the "colorthemes/beamercolorthemedark.sty". You can modify the styles there.

Another suggestion: If you are using matplotlib, I suggest exploring the CMasher color maps to find one that fits your color scheme:

## WARNINGS
1. This will use more ink to print, and may be more expensive.
2. Your printer may not get the colors exactly correct. For example, when I printed this poster, the blue and the grey backgrounds came out much darker than I intended. Your experience may vary.
